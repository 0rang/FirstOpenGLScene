## 40-50
- [X] A "complex" object/scene made of multiple convex objects
- [ ] Lighting, recognisable:
  - [ ] diffusive
  - [ ] specular

## 50-60
- [X] User Interaction (one element) 

## 60-70
- [ ] Animation i.e rotating objects
- [ ] Texture mapping (Eyes: Marc, Markus, Globe: Spider butt)
   (Marc says just setting the u,v is fine, although you might get creativity points for using the wrapping modes)
- [X] Convex object constructed from polygons 

## 70-100
- [ ] Hierarchichal modelling (push & pop matrix)
  - [ ] Partial motion within the object
  - [ ] Object itself should move in a circle through the scene
- [ ] Various UI elements, e.g:
  - [ ] Controls to set radius or speed of the object
  - [ ] Dialogue boxes to control material properties






# My own ideas
- [ ] Mech animation where all of its glut components do some elastic movement in a randomly generated direction vector. then returns to normal
- [ ] Convex polygonal object can be a spinning top tetrahedron 
- [ ] http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-7-model-loading/ << if you want to load some models
## Fluid project ideas
- [ ] 3D arrow that takes some vector and changes direction and colour based on the vector, but does not get longer than some clamp value
